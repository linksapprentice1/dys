1. Click CLICK_ME.exe
2. Select template.txt, located in the same folder as CLICK_ME.exe

A schedule webpage should appear and a text file in Notepad containing its code.

To make a schedule page:

1. Replace the information in template.txt file with corresponding schedule data (swap out the season and year, dates, team numbers, coach names, etc). Keep the formatting how it is (the tildes, newlines, etc. act as separators). 
Save the file as something other than template.txt so it doesn't get overwritten (i.e., File -> Save As -> Example.txt).
2. Run CLICK_ME.exe and select the file. Check the webpage to see if it looks right. If incorrect, modify the text file you made and run CLICK_ME.exe again.
3. Log into the Dedham Youth Soccer site
4. Click Town Schedule
5. Click 2014 Fall Schedules and click Page Properties to change the Page Name to the current season (i.e., 2015 Spring Schedules). Press Submit.
6. Click a schedule page in the list below 2014 Fall Schedules (i.e., U6 Boys). Click Page Properties to change the Page Name to a new schedule page name. Press Submit.
7. Click Edit to edit a schedule page. Click Source, and replace all the code with the code from the text file generated by the CLICK_ME.exe. 
You can do so by selecting all the text from the text file, right clicking, selecting copy, and then selecting the code on the source editting page and right-clicking and selecting paste. 
8. Click Submit. The schedule is now updated.
